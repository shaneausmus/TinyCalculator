# Tiny Calculator

This program is a tiny calculator implementation that operates similar to a four-function calculator. I created the GUI and interactive aspects of the program using the tkinter and tkmacosx modules.

For any specific questions, feel free to email at shane.s.ausmus@vanderbilt.edu. I'm aiming to extend this to a legitimate scientific calculator by around August 15th.
